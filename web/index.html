    needed stuff-
        states and switching states
            each state is the state of the webpage [0-4] for 1-5 states = landing, picking, adding, dividing, result
        only things begin updated: Main text (non-prompt text), Prompt Text(examples, when ready click next)

    landing page = "i can read your mind" + button prompt to start
    choosing page = "pick a number between 01-99" + prompt for next "page" + prompt for starting changed to "restart"
     - "next" button prompt "when you are ready press next" above it
